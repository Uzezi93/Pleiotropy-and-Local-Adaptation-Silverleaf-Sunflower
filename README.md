# Pleiotropy does not facilitate local adaptation in the Silverleaf sunflower (<i>Helianthus argophyllus</i>)

In this study, we explored connections between pleiotropy and local adaptation in the Texas endemic Silverleaf sunflower or 
<i>Helianthus argophyllus</i>. Populations of <i>H. argophyllus</i> exhibit a bimodal life history strategy consisting of tall, late-flowering forms and short early-flowering forms occurring in close geographical proximity. We suspect that the differential expression of life history traits within <i>H. argophyllus</i> populations might be linked to local adaptation and controlled by highly pleiotropic genes. We identified spatial selection, selective sweeps, and tested for local adaptation signatures. We assessed pleiotropy by examining if genes bearing adaptive mutations were more likely than expected to occupy central positions on gene coexpression networks. Our results show that candidate locally adapted genes showed significantly lower connectivity than non-adapted genes.
